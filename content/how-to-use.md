title: How to Use This Booklet
subtitle: Three modes, one structure, eight rules.
weight: 5
---

This booklet is designed for three modes:

**Mode 1: Read through.** Start at Rule 1, end at Rule 8. The arc follows a logic: Rules 1-3 address the _why_ (creating emotional momentum), Rules 4-6 address the _who_ (the people dimension), and Rules 7-8 address the _how_ (building and sustaining the system). An executive section at the end provides the measurement framework for leadership teams.

**Mode 2: Pick one rule.** Each rule is self-contained with its own case study, framework, action step, and worksheet. If you know where you're stuck, go straight there.

**Mode 3: Team session.** Pick 3 rules. Use the worksheets with your team. Build a 90-day plan using the AI Change Sprint (Appendix B). Walk out with specific commitments for Tuesday.

Every rule follows the same structure:

| Section | What It Contains |
| --- | --- |
| **The Rule** | Name + one-liner |
| **The Story** | A real company case study (\~1 page) |
| **The Science** | Connection to a proven change framework (\~half page) |
| **The Move** | What to do Monday morning (\~half page) |
| **The Worksheet** | One exercise to apply the rule |
